# Strok-Prediction-Group-Project
Contributors: Dr. Diganta sengupta,Subhash Mondal Sir, Yash raj singh and Amartya Pandey
Algorithms Involved:

Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Linear Regression, SVM, XgBoost and related Performance Metrics ->Accuracy, Precision, Confusion matrix, Recall and F1 Score
Ensemble Methods: Stacking (Alternate approach to Boosting and Bagging)

The boosting algorithms involves the use of XGBOOST.
all of the above imported from the sklear libraray that does encompasses all the algoithms required
